Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, aimed to expand their Android-exclusive game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based multiplatform offering. This game involves teams competing in rapid drawing-guessing rounds, and the project's goal was to adapt the game for diverse platforms ensuring it supports multiple team play, retains unique identifiers for games and teams, and operates a single game instance concurrently. They required a comprehensive approach to memory and storage management, employing platform-specific optimization and cloud-native technologies, including Linux containers and Kubernetes.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The documentation effectively outlined the requirements, design constraints, and proposed system architecture, providing a clear, comprehensive overview of the project's technical aspects. It emphasized the importance of scalability, performance, and security through cloud-native architecture, Linux containers, Kubernetes, and microservices, addressing both current and future technology demands.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document was helpful in systematically addressing the client's requirements and the technical challenges of developing a multiplatform game. It facilitated a structured approach to problem-solving, from evaluating different platforms' characteristics to recommending specific technologies and strategies for memory and storage management, thereby streamlining the development process.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One area for revision might be the evaluation of development tools and languages across different platforms. It could be improved by providing a more detailed comparison of the tools' specific advantages and limitations for game development, potentially incorporating feedback or case studies from similar projects to guide the choice of development environments more effectively.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were interpreted as requiring a seamless and engaging gaming experience across multiple platforms, with a focus on performance, security, and scalability. These needs were implemented into the software design by choosing appropriate technologies and architectures that enable efficient memory and storage management, and by planning for a cloud-native, containerized deployment. Considering the user's needs is crucial because it ensures that the software design directly contributes to a positive user experience, meeting or exceeding user expectations and fostering engagement and satisfaction.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The approach to designing the software involved a comprehensive evaluation of platform-specific requirements, memory and storage management strategies, and the adoption of cloud-native technologies for scalability and performance. For future projects, employing iterative design methodologies, such as Agile, could enhance flexibility in development and responsiveness to changing requirements. Additionally, incorporating user feedback early and often throughout the design process could further ensure that the software aligns closely with user needs and preferences.
